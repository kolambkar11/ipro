                      Understand, Deploy, and Hunt with MITREâ€™s ATT&amp;CK
                      Framework for early detection of hidden adversaries. To
                      minimize the impact of security breaches, it is essential
                      to identify them as early as possible. Cyber threat
                      hunting facilitates the early detection of attacks, using
                      high-fidelity telemetry and the latest threat intelligence
                      to proactively identify the activities of known and
                      unknown adversaries.
